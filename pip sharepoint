NEXT BIT OF DATA****************************************************************************************************




Here’s a clear explanation of that text, based **only on the surrounding content from your uploaded SharePoint page**. [\[NSS-CL-Inside-Sales | SharePoint\]](https://onyourside.sharepoint.com/sites/NSSCLDirect/SitePages/NSS-CL-Inside-Sales.aspx)

***

# ✅ **Explanation of the “Quick Links” Text**

The text appears to be a **navigation block** or **shortcut panel** meant to help Inside Sales team members quickly access the most commonly used internal tools, resources, and process pages.

Based on the structure and other elements in the page, this is most likely located **near the top of the Inside Sales SharePoint site**, serving as a centralized “hub” for daily operations. It fits with the rest of the page’s purpose, which is providing **Inside Sales workflows, initiatives, and reference materials**.

Below is what each item most likely represents **based on the surrounding page context and typical Inside Sales needs**:

***

## **Breakdown of Each Quick Link**

### **Inside Sales Home 🏠**

*   Likely takes you back to the main Inside Sales landing page.
*   Functions as the “home base” for all team resources.

### **Huddle Board 📋**

*   Matches the “Inside Sales Huddle Board” section on the page.
*   Likely a dynamic board showing team initiatives, updates, reminders, and priorities. [\[NSS-CL-Inside-Sales | SharePoint\]](https://onyourside.sharepoint.com/sites/NSSCLDirect/SitePages/NSS-CL-Inside-Sales.aspx)

### **Problem Solving Board ❌**

    *   Required daily procedures
    *   Sales process workflows
    *   Handling instructions
    *   Time-sensitive tasks

    *   Follow‑ups
    *   Production metrics

### **UW Submission Template**

*   A template used by Inside Sales to submit clean cases to underwriting.
*   Fits with the “UW Contacts” and “AI Agents (UW Coach)” sections already on the page. [\[NSS-CL-Inside-Sales | SharePoint\]](https://onyourside.sharepoint.com/sites/NSSCLDirect/SitePages/NSS-CL-Inside-Sales.aspx)

### **OneNote 📝**

*   Shared team OneNote notebook that stores:
    *   SOPs
    *   Quick references
    *   Call guides
    *   Team-based knowledge

### **Cross‑Sell List**

*   A list used to identify cross‑sell opportunities, likely tied to:
    *   Appetite expansion
    *   Book growth initiatives

### **All-In-One Form**

    *   Eligibility checks

# ⭐ **Summary**

This “Quick Links” block is essentially a **shortcut menu for top Inside Sales workflows and tools**, designed to keep frequently accessed pages one click away. It reflects the operational structure shown elsewhere on your Inside Sales page—focusing on:

*   Daily workflows
*   Underwriting coordination
*   Reporting
*   Onboarding
*   Team communication
*   Submission quality improvement
